There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 1.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

Like this one.1 3.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["blocks.html", "Unidad4 Blocks 4.1 Equations 4.2 Theorems and proofs 4.3 Callout blocks", " Unidad4 Blocks 4.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (4.1). 4.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 4.1. Theorem 4.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. 4.3 Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html "],["sharing-your-book.html", "Unidad5 Sharing your book 5.1 Publishing 5.2 404 pages 5.3 Metadata for sharing", " Unidad5 Sharing your book 5.1 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 5.2 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 5.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file. Read more about the features of this output format here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html Or use: ?bookdown::gitbook "]]
